# Trafficlightradar frontend

This is a proof of concept made for a school course.

Project contains configuration and module for creating a webapp using [trafficlightradar API](https://github.com/Dropa/trafficlightradar_api).


## What it does
-Fetches data from [trafficlightradar API](https://github.com/Dropa/trafficlightradar_api)

-Places markers on map from the fetched geodata

-You can click each marker to open an infowindow

See remaining tasks on [issue list](https://github.com/leflonen/geijjoo/issues)

## Scope
This project had a small scope, fetch data from an API and place markers on a map
based on the locations given from the API.

Due to the small scope, and our unfamiliarity with the technology used, the frontend could be improved upon.
To host this project it would need to be refactored and more tests would have to be done to guarantee it's stability. As of the current state, code works as intended but with some features missing.
